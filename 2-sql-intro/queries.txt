-- 1 What is SQL? What is DML? What is DDL? Recite the most important SQL commands.

SQL is a declarative querying and data manipulation language for relational database systems loosely based on relational algebra. DML is the subset of SQL concerned with "CRUD" operations - manipulating and extracting the stored data, while DDL is used for defining its structure and interrelationships. An additional subset is the DCL, "Data Control Language", which is used for managing access rights to tables and databases. The most important SQL commands include:

DML:

INSERT
SELECT 
UPDATE
DELETE

DDL:

CREATE DATABASE/TABLE
DROP DATABASE/TABLE
ALTER Table

-- 2 What is Transact-SQL (T-SQL)?

T-SQL is a proprietary extension to SQL developed by Microsoft that allows defining and performing advanced operations on data stored in SQL Server, including procedural language constructs that allow program logic similar to general purpose programmign languages.
